      <h3>Soesterhof</h3>
      <p>Soesterhof is a new residential area conceived and designed with the participation of its future neighbors
        through the organization of collective workshops.
        It is located in an old railroad track area in Amersfoort, which is undergoing a complete transformation. The
        area where Soesterhof is located is characterized by the fact that it is a "transition zone". It is literally
        located between a small-scale district and an industrial heritage of the city. The challenge is to build a
        project as neutral and sustainable as possible, where the social aspect is important: the creation of a common
        garden and a shared space to promote interaction are fundamental to create a community. The complex consists of
        40 houses distributed in a semi-closed polygon, with a ratio of 80% for sale and 20% rental.
        The participatory design has been carried out first through individual sessions, where each of the participants
        expressed his desires, and than with collective workshops, in order to give shape to a shared view.
